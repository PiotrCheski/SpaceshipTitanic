# Cosmic Titanic Data Engineering Project

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data engineering skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. During a research mission to Alpha Centauri, a team of scientists discovered a mysterious data carrier. Preliminary analysis revealed that the data pertains to passengers of the spacecraft Titanic. From historical archives on Earth, it is known that a thousand years ago, the Titanic lost communication after colliding with a cosmic rock. Since then, until now, humanity has been unaware of the fate of the passengers of the cosmic Titanic. As a data engineer, you have the chance to uncover the millennium-old mystery surrounding what determined whether some passengers reached their destination and others did not.

## Analysis Goals

1. Obtain as much valuable information as possible about passengers and the count of each passenger based on their characteristics.

2. Determine the factors that influenced success or failure in reaching the destination.

3. Create a machine learning model to predict whether a given passenger will reach their destination.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and is titled "Spaceship Titanic." It was provided by Addison Howard, Ashley Chow, and Ryan Holbrook. You can access the dataset on Kaggle at [Spaceship Titanic](https://kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).
