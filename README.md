# Cosmic Titanic Data Engineering Project

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data engineering skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. During a research mission to Alpha Centauri, a team of scientists discovered a mysterious data carrier. Preliminary analysis revealed that the data pertains to passengers of the spacecraft Titanic. From historical archives on Earth, it is known that a thousand years ago, the Titanic lost communication after colliding with a cosmic rock. Since then, until now, humanity has been unaware of the fate of the passengers of the cosmic Titanic. As a data engineer, you have the chance to uncover the millennium-old mystery surrounding what determined whether some passengers reached their destination and others did not.
